  <h2>How to Make Hearts of Palm Salad </h2>
  <p>"The hearts of palm take on the flavor of that vinaigrette so well," says culinary developer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). "Paired with all those crunchy vegetables, it's the perfect bite." You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here are a few tips from the recipe creator herself: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hearts of palm are pretty neutral, so they can take on whatever flavors you add to them. They make a great meat substitute – in this case, Nicole aims to mimic the flavors of a crab salad.</li>
    <li> The hearts of palm strips are delicate, so try not to be too rough on them. Gently fold them in at the end to preserve the shape and texture.</li>
    <li>To complete the meal, serve the hearts of palm salad over a bed of lettuce. Nicolel likes using butter lettuce, but you can use whatever variety you have on hand. For a heartier option, according to Nicole, you can chop up the hearts of palm a little more and serve the dish with tortilla chips. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> How to Store Hearts of Palm Salad </h2>
